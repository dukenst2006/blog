Portfolio assignment for Coursera 'Responsive Website Tutorial and Examples' course week 3
About this site…
This site was written for the portfolio assignment of the Coursera Responsive Website Tutorial and Examples course.

The general idea is to present a news blog about space and astronomy and allow users to comment on them. An RSS feed is supplied for new blog posts.

Blog entries can only be added by the 'Admin' account (password is 123456). To leave comments you need either a seperate Disqus account or to sign in via Facebook, Twitter, or Google.

The site will be deployed to Scalingo for a few days or so. This means that the RSS, news feed, and video links should work. There may be problems with cross site scripting warnings or denial of access on videos. The site is HTTPS and the component used to serve the video (Iframely) uses HTTP. The Chrome browser signals this with a grey shield icon on the right of the address field. Clicking on this gives you the option to ignore the warning and load the video.

The Code
The code can be found on GitHub.
