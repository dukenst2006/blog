Portfolio assignment for Coursera 'Responsive Website Tutorial and Examples' course week 3
About this site…
This site was written for the portfolio assignment of the Coursera Responsive Website Tutorial and Examples course.

The general idea is to present a news blog about space and astronomy and allow users to comment on them. An RSS feed is supplied for new blog posts.

Blog entries can only be added by the 'Admin' account (password is 123456). To leave comments you need either a seperate Disqus account or to sign in via Facebook, Twitter, or Google.
